# Ghez

Ghez (غِز) means "Plug" in Arabic Saudi Najdi dialect. I built this mini project to try the PETAL stack:

- [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/)
- [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Alpine JS](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine)
- [LiveView](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html)

You can check the app [here](https://ghez.gigalixirapp.com/)

## Todos

- [] Add Multi-range-input to allow the user to select the starting SOC and the target SOC.
